- **CLI Support**: `hawkfish migrate` and `hawkfish drain` commands

### üñ•Ô∏è Console Access (Framework)
- **WebSocket Console Proxy**: Secure console access with one-time tokens
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Framework for VNC, SPICE, and serial console access
- **Session Management**: Time-limited console sessions with audit logging
- **Security Model**: Project-scoped access with token-based authentication

### üíæ Storage Pools & Volumes
- **Storage Pool Management**: Support for directory, NFS, LVM, and iSCSI pools
- **Volume Operations**: Create, attach, detach, and resize storage volumes
- **Project Integration**: Volumes are project-scoped with quota enforcement
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for qcow2, raw, and VMDK volume formats

## API Enhancements

```

## CLI Enhancements

### New Command Groups
```bash
# Project management
hawkfish projects ls|create|rm
hawkfish projects members|add-member|remove-member

# Migration operations
hawkfish migrate <system> --to <host> [--live|--offline]
hawkfish drain <host>

# Storage management
hawkfish pools ls|create
hawkfish volumes ls|create
```

## Database Schema

### New Tables
- `hf_projects`: Project definitions with quotas
- `hf_project_roles`: Project member roles
- `hf_usage`: Resource usage tracking per project
- `hf_console_sessions`: Console session tokens
- `hf_storage_pools`: Storage pool definitions
- `hf_storage_volumes`: Storage volume metadata
- `hf_volume_attachments`: Volume-to-system mappings

### Schema Migrations
- Added `project_id` columns to existing tables (profiles, images, etc.)
- Automatic migration of existing resources to "default" project

## Events & Monitoring

### New Event Types
- `SystemMigrating` / `SystemMigrated`: Migration lifecycle
- `HostMaintenanceEntered` / `HostMaintenanceExited`: Host maintenance
- `VolumeAttached` / `VolumeDetached` / `VolumeResized`: Storage operations

## Security Enhancements

- **Project-scoped Authorization**: All resource access respects project membership
- **Console Security**: One-time tokens with configurable TTL
- **Quota Enforcement**: Prevents resource exhaustion via quotas

## Configuration Options

### New Environment Variables
```bash
# Console access
HF_CONSOLE_ENABLED=true
HF_CONSOLE_TOKEN_TTL=300
HF_CONSOLE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=600
```

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Migration Required**: Existing installations need database migration to add project support. All existing resources will be assigned to the "default" project.

## Deprecations

None in this release.

## Known Limitations

### Console Access
- Console proxy provides framework but requires libvirt graphics integration for production use
- VNC/SPICE protocols need additional WebSocket-to-TCP proxy implementation

### Migration  
- Live migration is currently mock implementation
- Requires shared storage or storage migration capability
- CPU compatibility checking needs libvirt integration

### Storage
- Storage operations are simulated and need libvirt storage pool integration
- Volume resize operations depend on guest OS support for online resize

## Next Release (v0.9.0)

Planned features:
- **OIDC/SSO Integration**: External authentication providers
- **Policy Engine**: OPA-based admission control
- **Real Console Integration**: Working VNC/SPICE proxy
- **Enhanced Migration**: Full libvirt migration implementation

## Upgrade Instructions

1. **Backup Database**: Always backup your HawkFish database before upgrading
2. **Update Configuration**: Review new environment variables
3. **Run Migration**: Database schema will auto-migrate on startup
4. **Update CLI**: Install new CLI version for project management features

## Contributors

This release includes significant architectural enhancements to support enterprise multi-tenancy and advanced VM management capabilities.
